#Mimic of Cam Strobel personal page
This is an imitation of Cam Strobel's personal page as an exercise in HTML and CSS for the Front-End engineering course at the Iron Yard. Mr. Strobel, if you find this, please forgive the sloppiness of a first-week student developer.

The original page can be found at http://www.camstrobel.com/.
