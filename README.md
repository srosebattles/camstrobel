#Mimic of Cam Strobel personal page
This is an imitation of Cam Strobel's personal page as an exercise in HTML and CSS for the Front-End engineering course at the Iron Yard. Mr. Strobel, if you find this, please forgive the sloppiness of a first-week student developer.

The original page can be found at http://www.camstrobel.com/.

Things I still need to figure out include, but are not necessarily limited to, media queries, favicons, and making the arrows blue. I figured out how to do that with standard keyboard characters, at least.
